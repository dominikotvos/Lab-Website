# CourtSync - Tennis Live Scores

## Project Overview

CourtSync is a comprehensive platform designed to solve a common problem in tennis tournaments: the unpredictable timing of matches. By providing real-time score tracking across multiple courts, CourtSync eliminates waiting frustrations and keeps players informed of exactly when their court will be available.

## Key Features

- **Live Score Dashboard**: Track multiple matches simultaneously on a single screen
- **Bluetooth Hardware Integration**: Connect mechanical scoreboards to automatically capture scores
- **Mobile App**: Manually input scores or connect with nearby scoreboards
- **Web Platform**: Display live match data and custom dashboards for clubs
- **Battery-Optimized Design**: Hardware clients designed for extended court-side usage

## Development Journey

As computer science students at KdG, we took on the challenge of developing CourtSync in just 6 weeks. Our project required us to learn entirely new technologies: .NET, Blazor, C#, and MAUI. We integrated three components: an Arduino-based hardware client using Hall Effect sensors to detect scoreboard changes, a mobile application for Bluetooth connectivity, and a web platform to display real-time match data.
